The notes provided here are only in form of short bullet points. If you are interested in more ellaborated notes, please let me know!
## 1.1.1 Identify the context for which a new system is planned.
1. Current System: investigation, collection of data, analysis
2. Evaluation of current system: What works good, and what doesn’t?
3. Propose new system

Factors to consider:
- Compatibility to old system
- Infrastructure
- Hardware/Software requirements
- Cost
- Time
- Staffing
- Ethical issues

## 1.1.2 Describe the need for change management.
- Planning transition to the new system
	- Hardware
	- Communications equipment and software
	- System software
	- Documentation and support
	- Running and mantaining system
- Approval by management
- Type of implementation of the new system
- Implemented with minimal and accepted risk to existing infrastructure
- Improved functionionality and stability

## 1.1.3 Outline compatibility issues resulting from situations including legacy systems or business mergers.
- Legacy Systems:
	- Old systems, often inherited from another company
	- Outdated
	- Poor competitiveness & compatibility to modern equivalents
- Evaluation of system replacement costs vs. maintaining costs
- Business mergers:
	- Time and money in replacing the system vs. Data redundancy running systems independently
	- Language differences
	- Different versions of a system in an international business may create issues
	- American vs European system (metric vs. Imperial)
	- Data structures
	- Different system environments

## 1.1.4 Compare the implementation of systems using a client’s hardware with hosting systems remotely.
*Software-as-a-service*:
- Remotely hosted computer system
- Servers lend from software manufacturer
- Managed and maintained by software manufacturer
- Application Service Provider (ASP)
