This section is evaluates different systems. The first evaluation is for control systems in general and is followed by a comparison of centralized and distributed systems. Lastly the more specific implications on prisoner tagging, surveillance, CCTV and safety systems are discussed.

## General
### Pros
- Computers can respond very rapidly to change.
- Systems can run 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
- Control systems can operate in places that humans would find dangerous or awkward.
- Outputs are consistent and error free.
- Computers can process data quickly and machines can operate faster than humans.

### Contra
- The software for the control system is specialized and may cost a lot of money to develop
- If the computer malfunctions the system will not work
- If there is a power cut the system will not work
- The computer can’t react to unexpected events like a human could. It can only respond in the way it has been programmed to.
- It can cause some concern if total control for a system and the decisions are handed over to a computer.

## Tagging prisioners
### Pros
- Government no longer needs to house or feed the prisoner in a prison so there is a cost saving.
- Can be safer for the community as people who may not normally be sent to prison can be effectively monitored.
- Families who rely on convicted person can continue to live with them and receive financial/emotional support.
- There may be improved rehabilitation as offenders are not removed from society and put in a “criminal” environment.

### Cons
- Risk of devices being removed and prisoners offending.
- Does not necessarily prevent any future crimes
- System is expensive to set up.
- System may not be reliable and there may be areas where the system does not cover.
- Extra people are required to monitor and intervene when there are problems.
- There may be privacy issues.
- The security of the system is important as any hacking would reveal sensitive data

## Surveillance
### Pros
- Preventing crime and even terrorism (NSA)
- Potentially increased safety
- More evidence for finding criminals
- Superiors can ensure productivity, e.g. the boss tracking his employees, or the teacher ensuring that students work

### Cons
- Privacy concerns -> collection of user data from normal people, even if they don’t do anything (be it crime, or being unproductive)
- Chance of misuse/abuse
- Personal information is very sensitive and holds power -> can be used for criminal actions as blackmailing or even murder

## CCTV
### Pros
- Helps looking at different places at the same time
- Helps maintain security
- Video clips can be used as evidence for investigations
- Lead to reduction in damages such as vandalism or theft
- Can be conveniently monitored over the internet

### Cons
- Too many can intrude a person’s privacy
- Doesn’t necessarily prevent crime
- Misuse of captured pictures from public surveillance
- Can be dangerous in the wrong hands, e.g. stalkers
- Surveillance cameras can be hacked, which leads to misuse

## Improved safety systems
### Pros
- Improve safety for users, e.g. passengers in a car
- Can save lives
- May open more job opportunities as skilled workers are needed for maintainance

### Cons
- Subject to technical failure, e.g. bugs
- More complex and harder to maintain  requires skilled workers, e.g. a car mechanic may not be able to repair the car, needing an electrical engineer
