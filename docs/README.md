## Installation
If you'd like to run the website locally (e.g. to visually see any changes), you'll need to install following dependencies:
- [Node & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), I recommend using `nvm` for version management
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
Remaining dependencies can be installed using
```
npm install
```
and 
```
bundle install
```
After this you can either use `bundle exec jekyll serve` or `gulp` to serve the website locally.
