<p>
As the creator of this website, I want to learn about how my audience interacts with it and the content, so that I can improve on it as much as possible.</p>
<p>For this reason, <i>cs-ib.net</i> uses Google Analytics.  Google Analytics is a tool that records data about visitors to provide a deeper insight into the website's audience.
</p>
<h3>What data are being tracked?</h3>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>How you arrived at this website</li>
	<li>What pages you visit and for how long</li>
	<li>What computer system you use</li>
	<li>And a bit more</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>What are these data used for?</h3>
<p>
Google Analytics provides me a way to understand which topics are most needed, allowing me to focus on improving those. It also helps me to see if the website audience grows - and how important last minute revision is for IB students.
</p>
<p>At no point does this information contain any personally identifying data and all activity is within the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">Google Analytics Terms of Service</a></p>
<h3>Opting out</h3>
<p>
If you would not like Google Analytics to track such information from you, you always have the option to opt out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as of now this website does not provide a method for this website only, but you can use the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Ananalytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a> which will prevent Google Analytics to collect data from you on any website.
